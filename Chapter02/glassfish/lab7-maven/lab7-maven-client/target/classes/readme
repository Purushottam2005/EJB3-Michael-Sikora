tested in windows 7

-you might have glassfish in C:\Program Files\glassfish-3.1.1
-better copy to  C:\glassfish-3.1.1 (windows 7 security might not allow you to create clients in program files)

- build lab6-maven (before build the client will  miss the jar (type library) dependency.

-deploy manually lab6-maven/lab6-maven-ear/target/lab6-maven-ear-1.0.ear to glassfish


-go  to glassfish bin

C:\glassfish-3.1.1\bin>asadmin get-client-stubs --appname lab7-maven-ear-1.0 c:\
local
Command get-client-stubs executed successfully.

C:\glassfish-3.1.1\bin>appclient -jar c:\local\lab7-maven-ear-1.0Client.jar
Time is: 01:54:13 PM - Have a Nice Day

C:\glassfish-3.1.1\bin>

the idea here is that while the client needs the remote TimeServiceBean
NiceDayServiceBean is only needed at the server side so why declare it remote?
by declaring it local you avoid the passivating-network-activating
