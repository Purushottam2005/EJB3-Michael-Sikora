to get a default jndi.property in the classpath of the client:
right click inside pom - insert code - find gf-client-3.1.1 
(book says appserv-rt.jar is enough but it did not work for me)

maven will find in central if you don't have it in your local maven repository

as long as you have gf-client in your classpath there is no need to specify context properties.
application will take the default jndi.property that comes with glassfish
manually deploy lab1-maven-ear-1.0


to run the client..

from netbeans right click lab1-maven-client --properties>---run>
edit VM options to show -DAS_DERBY_INSTALL="C:/Program Files/glassfish-3.1.1/javadb"  or whereever javadb is installed.
right click and run lab1-maven-client
