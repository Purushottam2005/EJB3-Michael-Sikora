1)	netbeans mvn clean and build
2)	manually deploy :
W:\LA\academic\booksample\ejb3\5609_Code\Chapter07\glassfish\lab1-maven\lab1-maven-ear\target
3)	since for this example I have moved glassfish to c:\ make sure you also move javadb to c:\
(find in C:\Program Files\glassfish-3.1.1\javadb)
This is not needed to run but to avoid getting the warning “Cannot find javadb client jar”
4)	from the command prompt:
a)	get the client stubs
C:\glassfish-3.1.1\bin>asadmin get-client-stubs --appname lab1-maven-ear-1.0 c:\local
Command get-client-stubs executed successfully.
b)	Run the application
C:\glassfish-3.1.1\bin>appclient -jar c:\local\lab1-maven-ear-1.0Client.jar 1 john doe
[Customer Id =1,first name=john,last name=doe]
[Audit Id =1,message= customer add attempt]
